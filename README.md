# GW-M5610-1ER-backplate

The M5610 by Casio while being a great watch causes skin irritation in some people due to the metal backplate.
These 3D-printable models should enable you to create your own backplate from PLA/ABS etc. The model has been created with Open SCAD which enables you to write code to generate a 3D object from basic shapes.

# Caution
This might mess with the waterproofness of your watch. I personally never had problems with the modded backplate while showering or doing dishes but you should probably not sumberge it in water (swimming).
